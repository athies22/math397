example,
there
was
a
time
when
Ancient
Greek
metaphysics
assumed
that
any
measurable
thing,
i.e.,
anything
with
a
magnitude,
could
be
composed
of
incommensurable
units.
This
manifested
in
the
atom
hypothesis,
centuries
ahead
of
of
its
time.
It
also
required
that
irrational
numbers
such
as
$\sqrt
{2}$
could
not
exist,
when
they
in
fact
do.
This
was
discovered
by
a
student
of
Pythagoras
when
examining
a
unit
square,
whose
diagonal
is
of
length
$\sqrt
{2}$.
Although
this
upset
the
Pythagoreans
at
the
time,
centuries
later
Euclid
would
go
on
to
include
in
\textit
{The
Elements}
an
entire
book
on
irrational
numbers
(Book
X,
the
longest
book
in
\textit
{The
Elements}).

includes
this
as
the
first
proposition
from
the

book

Book
X
is
by

the
longest
of
the
books
from
\textit

is
devoted
to
the
study
of
irrational
numbers.
